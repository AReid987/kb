## QUOTES

- "GraphRAG is really a two-step process: indexing and LLM orchestration."
- "It enhances search relevancy by having a holistic view of semantics across the dataset."
- "We're not just looking for named entities; we're looking for relationships between those entities."
- "This allows us to create weighted graphs from those relationships that are far richer."
- "Once we have the graph, we can utilize graph machine learning to do semantic aggregations."
- "GraphRAG allows us to actually look at the underlying provenance."
- "It also allows us to actually use a second agent to really help reduce hallucinations."
- "GraphRAG can show new opportunity spaces where regular RAG struggles."
- "The important piece here is that though GraphRAG is using a lot more resources, it's providing much richer answers."
- "This is actually a visualization of the entire graph network map of this dataset."
- "Each of these nodes represents an entity that the LLM extracted."
- "This knowledge graph did not exist before the LLM was exposed to all the transcripts."
- "We can see things like RNA virus, Spike glycoprotein, SARS Corona virus 2."
- "It actually goes to show that GraphRAG is actually working in the sense that it pulled out all the entities."
- "GraphRAG's creation of knowledge graphs from transcripts showcases LLM's potential."
