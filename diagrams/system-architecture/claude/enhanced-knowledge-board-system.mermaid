/**
 * This diagram represents an enhanced knowledge board system, which consists of the following key components:
 *
 * - Central Knowledge Graph (CKG): Stores and manages the overall knowledge base.
 * - Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKG): Individual knowledge graphs that are influenced by the CKG and can in turn influence the Agentic Crew.
 * - Data Sources (DS): External data sources that stream data into the Data Processing (DP) component.
 * - Data Processing (DP): Processes the incoming data from DS and updates the CKG.
 * - Agentic Crew (AC): Scouts the data sources and interacts with the PKGs.
 * - Founders (F), Startups (S), and Consortium (C): Collaborate and interact with the PKGs.
 * - AI Arbiter (AA): Directs the AC and weighs the inputs from the Consortium.
 * - Human Owners (HO): Instruct the AC and guide the AA.
 * - Knowledge Board (KB): Generates insights based on the PKGs and informs the Founders.
